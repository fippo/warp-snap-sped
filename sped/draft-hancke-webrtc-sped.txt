1.  Introduction

   The current WebRTC connection setup, as outlined in [RFC8829], incurs
   4 RTTs before media can be sent and 6 RTTs before the data channel
   opens.  The serialization of ICE and DTLS is a large contributor to
   that as illustrated below (for DTLS 1.2):

   Client                                       Server
      |                                            |
      |------------- SDP Offer (actpass)---------->|
      |<-1---------- SDP Answer (passive)----------|
      |                                            |
      |<-2---------- ICE/Connectivity Checks ----->|
      |                                            |
      |------------- DTLS ClientHello ------------>|
      |<-3---------- DTLS ServerHello —------------|
      |------------- DTLS Finished --------------->|
      |<-4---------- DTLS Finished ----------------|
      |------------- Application data ------------>|

   In addition to that deployment experience has shown that there are
   reliability issues caused by the exponential backoff done by DTLS
   implementations in particular on connections with a high round trip
   time whereas the underlying ICE layer is doing periodic checks
   without exponential backoff.

   The protocol defined in this specification aims to reduce this by
   embedding the DTLS handshake into STUN which eliminates the delay
   caused by the serialization of the protocols and enhances reliability
   with more frequent resends and acknowledgements.  This is backward
   compatible with the demultiplexing of multiple ICE sessions on the
   same port which is frequently done by ICE servers and includes the
   DTLS handshake in the calculation of the STUN message-integrity
   field.

   The protocol is designed to work with DTLS 1.2, DTLS 1.3 and can
   operate with DTLS 1.3 with PQC groups which increase the DTLS
   handshake flight size.  As described in WARP-DOCUMENT it can reduce
   the number of RTTs to 2 which makes it on-par with the older SDES
   approach for some scenarios.

2.  Terminology

   *DTLS Flight*: one of the DTLS handshake messages defined in
   Section 5.7 of [RFC9147].  A flight may be split into multiple DTLS
   packets when the size of the flight exceeds the MTU.

   *ICE candidate pair*: TODO

3.  SDP Offer/Answer procedures

   NOTE: *no consensus yet*

3.1.  General

   This section defines how the ‘sped’ ICE options can be negotiated
   using the SDP offer/answer mechanism.  Negotiating this in SDP
   provides that the other side is prepared to receive the new
   attributes even in packets that are sent without prior STUN consent
   [RFC7675].

3.2.  Generating the Initial SDP Offer

   If the offering endpoint supports the extension defined in this
   specification, it includes the "sped" ICE options in the SDP.  The
   offerer MUST be prepared to receive the STUN attributes described
   below even before receiving the SDP answer.

3.3.  Generating the SDP Answer

   An answering endpoint not supporting the ice-option described in this
   document must not include it in its response.  Otherwise the endpoint
   includes the "sped" ice-option in its answer and can start using the
   STUN attributes using the semantics defined below.

3.4.  Offerer Processing of the SDP Answer

   If the answer does not include the ‘sped’ ice-option, the offerer
   MUST ignore the STUN attributes defined in this specification and
   MUST NOT send them.  Otherwise the offerer includes the STUN
   attributes using the semantics defined below.

3.5.  Modifying the Session

   Subsequent offers and answers MUST include the ice-option in the
   negotiated SDP with the same value as in the initial negotiation.
   Remote offers MAY renegotiate ice-options only when negotiating a new
   DTLS association as described in Section 5.5 of [RFC8842].

4.  Embedding DTLS in STUN

   For the protocol described in this specification the DTLS handshake
   is started before ICE finds a valid pair and SHOULD disable the DTLS
   resend timeout as resends will be handled by the STUN/application
   layer.

   For the purpose of resends, the ICE agent stores the outgoing DTLS
   packets until their receipt has been acknowledged as described below.

4.1.  For pairs that are in WAITING state

   When an ICE candidate pair has not received a response DTLS can not
   be sent without being embedded as the candidate pair does not have
   consent from the other side.  In that state, when sending a STUN
   binding request the STUN agent MUST embed any pending DTLS flights
   into the STUN packet using the META-DTLS-IN-STUN attribute.  If the
   flight is split into multiple fragments, a separate binding request
   is sent for each fragment.

   When receiving a binding request with an META-DTLS-IN-STUN attribute
   the DTLS response to any flight contained therein can be directly
   embedded in the binding response.

4.2.  For pairs in SUCCEEDED state

   When the ICE candidate pair has received a binding response and is in
   succeeded state, any new DTLS flights SHOULD immediately be sent
   without being embedded in STUN or waiting for the next ICE check.

   When the STUN agent is sending a scheduled check as described in
   Section 5.8 of [RFC5245] it should add any pending acknowledgements
   and then embed any pending DTLS packet into the STUN message.

4.3.  ICE-lite considerations

   TODO: go through Jonas' rules

4.4.  Resending flights

   The STUN agent stores outgoing DTLS packets and their CRC-32 hash
   that are sent either embedded in STUN messages using the META-DTLS-
   IN-STUN attribute or directly and resends them TODO(at what pace)
   until it receives an acknowledgement of the receipt of those packets
   as described below.

   Resends should happen with the regularly scheduled ICE checks but MAY
   be triggered by the receipt of an acknowledgment and determining that
   a packet did not arrive as expected (either because it was lost or it
   arrived out of order).

4.5.  Receipt acknowledgements

   The STUN agent acknowledges the receipt of DTLS packets by including
   the CRC-32 of the packet in the META-DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
   attribute.  The STUN agent stops including the META-DTLS-IN-STUN-
   ACKNOWLEDGEMENT in messages it sends when receiving a STUN message
   that includes a META-DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT attribute but no
   META-DTLS-IN-STUN attribute which signals that the remote STUN agent
   has completed the DTLS handshake.

   *TODO: needs consensus* During the DTLS handshake the receiving STUN
   agent MAY acknowledge packets both received embedded in STUN as well
   as received without embedding.

   *TODO: needs consensus* The acknowledgments only cover the current
   outstanding flight, similar to the DTLS 1.3 ACKs defined in Section 7
   of [RFC9147] and the client should clear the list of pending outgoing
   packets when preparing to send a new flight.

   This implies that the META-DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT will have a
   length of 0 with two exceptions: * when acknowledging the fourth
   flight of a DTLS 1.2 handshake * when acknowledging the partial
   receipt of a flight consisting of multiple packets, e.g.

   When a sender receives a STUN binding response for a packet that
   included an embedded DTLS packet it adds the CRC-32 of that packet to
   the list of acknowledgements from the META-DTLS-IN-STUN-
   ACKNOWLEDGEMENT attribute unless the CRC-32 is already included.

   When a receiver receives a STUN binding response for a packet that
   includes a META-DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT attribute it can remove
   the CRC-32s from the list of received packets.

4.6.  Handling flights consisting of multiple packets

   TODO: sending, receiving, acknowledgement.  Send in batch?

4.7.  MTU considerations

   Embedding DTLS in STUN requires considerations for reducing the MTU
   used by DTLS for the fragmentation of the handshake.  In addition to
   the STUN header the following attributes must be taken into account:

   +==============================+======+============================+
   | Attribute                    | Size | Defined in                 |

                                 Table 1

   Applications that use custom STUN attributes MUST reduce the DTLS MTU
   further.

   TODO: do we need wording for Section 7.1 of [RFC5389] (576 bytes for
   IPv4, 1200 for IPv6) in particular for PQC?  We can argue that WebRTC
   works despite sending packets larger than 576 by default)

5.  Example negotiation

   The normal negotiation process serializes DTLS after STUN as shown
   below for a DTLS 1.3 handshake:

   Client                                       Server
      |                                            |
      |------------- SDP Offer (actpass)---------->|
      |<-1---------- SDP Answer (passive)----------|
      |                                            |
      |<-2---------- ICE/Connectivity Checks ----->|
      |                                            |
      |------------- DTLS ClientHello ------------>|
      |<-3---------- DTLS ServerHello/Fin----------|
      |------------- DTLS Finished --------------->|
      |------------- Application data ------------>|

   Embedding the DTLS handshake into the STUN Binding Requests reduces
   the setup time by one RTT:

   Client                                       Server
      |                                            |
      |------------- SDP Offer (actpass) --------->|
      |<-1---------- SDP Answer (passive) -------->|
      |                                            |
      |----- ICE Check + DTLS ClientHello -------->|
      |<-2-- ICE Response + DTLS ServerHello/Fin --|
      |----- DTLS Finished (lost) --------x        |
      |------------- Application data ------------>|
      |----- ICE Check + DTLS Finished (resend)--->|

6.  New STUN attributes

   This STUN extension defines the following new attributes:

   *  *0xC070*: META-DTLS-IN-STUN (TODO: new name, same code)

   *  *0xC071*: META-DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (TODO: ^)

   Some of these attributes have lengths that are not multiples of 4.
   By the rules of STUN, any attribute whose length is not a multiple of
   4 bytes MUST be immediately followed by 1 to 3 padding bytes to
   ensure the next attribute (if any) would start on a 4-byte boundary
   (see [RFC5389]).

6.1.  META-DTLS-IN-STUN

   The META-DTLS-IN-STUN attribute may be present in binding requests,
   responses and indications.  The value portion of this attribute is
   variable length and consists of the DTLS handshake flights as
   described in Section 5.1 of [RFC9147] or Section 4.2 of [RFC6347].

   If the length of this attribute is not a multiple of 4, then padding
   must be added after this attribute.  If the value portion of this
   attribute is empty or the first byte is not DTLS (i.e. between 20 and
   63 (inclusive) as described in Section 3 of [RFC9443]) the attribute
   SHOULD be silently discarded

   Once the DTLS handshake is completed this attribute SHOULD be
   silently discarded.

6.2.  META-DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

   The META-DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT attribute may be present in
   binding requests, responses and indications.  The value portion of
   this attribute is variable length and consists of up to four CRC-32
   values that are computed for the META-DTLS-IN-STUN values whose
   receipt the sender acknowledges (similar to the STUN FINGERPRINT
   attribute defined in Section 15.5 of [RFC5389].

   If the length of the value is not a multiple of four or exceeds 16
   bytes this attribute SHOULD be silently discarded.  The order does
   not need to match the order in which the packets were received.

   The attribute MAY be empty but included in a binding request or
   binding response to signal support for the protocol defined in this
   specification.  This typically happens when the SDP answerer has a
   "passive" DTLS role and sends binding requests which may arrive at
   the SDP offerer before the answer.  It is recommended that this
   attribute is included before the META-DTLS-IN-STUN attribute.

7.  Security Considerations

   *TODO* This has security implications.  In particular caching DTLS
   flights and resending them.  This is compatible with the replay
   detection

   *TODO*: Upside: DTLS is authenticated as it is now covered by the
   STUN M-I.

   *TODO*: Larger packets without consent, DDoS consideration needed?

8.  IANA Considerations

   *TODO*: Attributes already registered, maybe rename them

   IANA has registered the following ICE option in the "ICE Options"
   subregistry of the "Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
   registry", following the procedures defined in [RFC6336].

   *ICE Option*: sped

   *Contact*: IESG iesg@ietf.org (mailto:iesg@ietf.org)

   *Change controller*: IESG

   *Description*: An ICE option of 'sped' indicates support for
   embedding DTLS in STUN as described in this specification.

9.  Prior Work

9.1.  ICE-DTLS

   The ICE-DTLS draft from 2012 proposed a similar mechanism to SPED, in
   which a single RTT could be removed from session setup by replacing
   STUN Request and Response messages with DTLS ClientHello and
   ServerHello messages (rather than piggybacking the DTLS messages as
   SPED does).

   The ICE-DTLS mechanism ends up being considerably more complex than
   SPED, on account of the fact that the entirety of ICE functionality
   needs to be ported over to DTLS (eg consent checks) or retained as a
   complementary approach (eg peer address discovery).  Furthermore,
   since it changes the details of connectivity negotiation, it is not
   backward compatible and therefore must be negotiated via SDP ice-
   options.

   SPED, on the other hand, is inherently backward compatible with
   existing WebRTC implementations.  It is also more compatible with
   demultiplexing multiple ICE sessions using different STUN username
   fragments on the same UDP port.
