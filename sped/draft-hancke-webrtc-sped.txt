1.  Introduction

   The current WebRTC connection setup, as outlined in [RFC8829], incurs
   4 RTTs before media can be sent and 6 RTTs before the data channel
   opens.  The serialization of ICE and DTLS is a large contributor to
   that as illustrated below (for DTLS 1.2):

   Client                                       Server
      |                                            |
      |------------- SDP Offer (actpass)---------->|
      |<-1---------- SDP Answer (passive)----------|
      |                                            |
      |<-2---------- ICE/Connectivity Checks ----->|
      |                                            |
      |------------- DTLS ClientHello ------------>|
      |<-3---------- DTLS ServerHello -------------|
      |------------- DTLS Finished --------------->|
      |<-4---------- DTLS Finished ----------------|
      |                                            |
      |------------- Application data ------------>|

   In addition, deployment experience has shown reliability issues,
   caused by packet loss and the exponential backoff timer of DTLS
   implementation, particularly on connections with a high round-trip
   time.  The underlying ICE layer, in contrast, uses periodic checks
   without exponential backoff.

   The protocol defined in this specification aims to reduce this by
   embedding the DTLS handshake into STUN which eliminates the delay
   caused by the serialization of the protocols and enhances reliability
   with more frequent resends and acknowledgements.  The protocol is
   backward compatible with existing mechanisms for demultiplexing
   multiple ICE sessions on a single port, a common practice for ICE
   servers.  The protocol is designed for use with DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347]
   and DTLS 1.3 [RFC9147].  It can also accommodate post-quantum
   cryptography (PQC) which can significantly increase the size of DTLS
   handshake flights and number of packets.

   The mechanism described can reduce the number of round-trips for
   session establishment, in some scenarios to as little as a single
   round-trip, which is comparable to the latency of the SDES key
   exchange mechanism [RFC4568].

2.  Terminology

   *DTLS Flight*: A set of DTLS handshake messages sent by one peer as
   defined in Section 4 of [RFC9147].  A flight can consist of one or
   more messages, which may be split into multiple DTLS records.

   *ICE Candidate*: A transport address, consisting of an IP address and
   port, that is a potential point of contact for communication with a
   peer.

   *ICE candidate pair*: A pair consisting of a local and a remote ice
   candidate.  Initially, it is unknown whether the pair is usable for
   sending data or not, but this is explored by the ICE agents.

   *ICE Agent*: A peer acting according to the ICE protocol.  This
   involves enumerating local ICE candidates and sending them to the
   peer, and systematically trying ICE Candidate pairs for usability.

   *ICE Lite (Agent)*: A peer using a subset of the ICE procedure that
   does not send STUN binding requests but only replies to them.  ICE
   Lite is typically used on servers.

3.  Embedding DTLS in STUN

3.1.  Example negotiation

   The normal negotiation process serializes DTLS after STUN as shown
   below for a DTLS 1.3 handshake:

   Client                                       Server
      |                                            |
      |------------- SDP Offer (actpass)---------->|
      |<-1---------- SDP Answer (passive)----------|
      |                                            |
      |<-2---------- ICE/Connectivity Checks ----->|
      |                                            |
      |------------- DTLS ClientHello ------------>|
      |<-3---------- DTLS ServerHello/Fin----------|
      |------------- DTLS Finished --------------->|
      |------------- Application data ------------>|

   Embedding the DTLS handshake into the STUN Binding Requests reduces
   the setup time by one RTT:

   Client                                       Server
      |                                            |
      |------------- SDP Offer (actpass) --------->|
      |<-1---------- SDP Answer (passive) -------->|
      |                                            |
      |----- ICE Check + DTLS ClientHello -------->|
      |<-2-- ICE Response + DTLS ServerHello/Fin --|
      |----- DTLS Finished (lost) --------x        |
      |------------- Application data ------------>|
      |----- ICE Check + DTLS Finished (resend)--->|

3.2.  Embedding data, acknowledgements and resends

   The protocol defined in this specification embeds DTLS data as a STUN
   attribute, similar to the DATA attribute defined in [RFC5766].  The
   recipient acknowledges data with this attribute using another STUN
   attribute containing a list of CRC-32 hashes of the data.

   In addition to allowing saving one round-trip time for establishing
   the connection this has also shown to be useful for dealing with
   packet loss due to the higher frequency of ICE connectvity checks
   compared to DTLS resends (which commonly use an exponential backoff)
   as well as utilizing that ICE is potentially probing multiple
   candidate pairs.  This is particularly important for fragmented
   handshake packets, such as those used in DTLS-PQC, where only one of
   many packets in a DTLS flight might be lost and need retransmission.

   While some of the semantics defined in this specification are
   specific to establishing the DTLS connection, the concept of using
   STUN attributes, e.g. on the periodic STUN consent defined in
   [RFC7675], as a transport for embedding data * whose receipt should
   be acknowledged * should be sent on multiple paths * is not time-
   critical is applicable on a wider scope and can be specified by
   defining STUN attribute pairs for data and acknowledgements.

3.3.  ICE procedures

   To manage delivery of DTLS handshake packets, the ICE agent maintains
   a list of outbound DTLS packets that have not yet been acknowledged
   by the peer.  Each packet is identified by a CRC-32 hash.  Packets
   are resent until they are acknowledged.

   Packets can be sent embedded in STUN messages using the META-DTLS-IN-
   STUN attribute, or without embedding on a validated ICE candidate
   pair.

   The agent also maintains a list of the CRC-32 hashes of received DTLS
   handshake packets to send as acknowledgements to the peer.

3.3.1.  Inband discovery and negotiation

   The protocol is using in-band discovery to determine support in
   addition to the use of ice-options for negotiation using SDP offer/
   answer described below.  This is necessary as the STUN binding
   requests may reach the offerer before the SDP answer.

   Until the DTLS handshake has finished, the ICE agent includes the
   META-DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT and META-DTLS-IN-STUN attributes in
   binding requests and responses as described below.

   As a "closing handshake" signaling that this protocol (and the
   embedded DTLS handshake) has finished, the ICE agent

   *  stops including the META-DTLS-IN-STUN attribute in STUN messages
      it sends when receiving a STUN messages that includes an empty
      META-DTLS-IN-STUN attribute and a META-DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGMENT
      attribute.

   *  stops including the META-DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT attribute in
      STUN messages it sends when receiving a STUN message that includes
      a META-DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT attribute but no META-DTLS-IN-
      STUN attribute.

   An ICE agent receiving a STUN binding request or response that
   contains neither a META-DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT nor a META-DTLS-
   IN-STUN attribute determines that the peer does not support the
   protocol defined in this specification and stops including of these
   attributes.

3.3.2.  Receipt acknowledgements

   An ICE agent maintains two lists related to DTLS packet delivery:

   *  A "pending" list of CRC-32 hashes of all outbound DTLS packets
      that have not yet been acknowledged.

   *  A "received" list of CRC-32 hashes of all unique inbound DTLS
      packets that it has processed.

   When an agent sends a STUN message, it includes the contents of its
   "received" list in a META-DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT attribute.
   This list MUST be included, even if empty, until the ICE agent
   receives a STUN binding request or response that contains a META-
   DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT attribute but does not contain a META-
   DTLS-IN-STUN attribute.  This acts as a "closing handshake" for the
   embedding.

   When an agent receives a STUN binding request or response containing
   a META-DTLS-IN-STUN attribute, it calculates the CRC-32 hash of the
   embedded DTLS packet.  If this hash is not already in its "received"
   list, it adds it.

   An outbound DTLS packet is considered acknowledged and removed from
   the "pending" list if either of these conditions is met:

   *  A STUN message is received from the peer containing a META-DTLS-
      IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT attribute that includes the packet's
      CRC-32 hash.

   *  For a DTLS packet sent embedded in a STUN binding request, a STUN
      binding success response is received for that request.  This
      serves as an implicit acknowledgement.

   The "pending" list is cleared when the DTLS layer signals that

   *  a new flight is going to be sent.

   *  the current flight of packets has timed out and a resend is going
      to happen.

3.3.3.  Completion of the DTLS handshake

   The DTLS layer MUST notify the ICE agent when the DTLS handshake is
   complete, its role and what DTLS version was negotiated.

   The ICE agent clears the "pending" list of outgoing packets if either
   * the DTLS layer is acting as a DTLS client and the DTLS version is
   1.2, or * the DTLS layer is acting as a DTLS server and the DTLS
   version is 1.3.

3.3.4.  For pairs that are in WAITING state

   When an ICE candidate pair has not received a response, DTLS can not
   be sent without being embedded as the candidate pair does not have
   consent from the other side.  In that state, when sending a STUN
   binding request the ICE agent embeds

   *  any pending acknowledgments using the META-DTLS-IN-STUN-
      ACKNOWLEDGMENT attribute and

   *  the next pending DTLS packet (determined in a round-robin fashion)
      using the META-DTLS-IN-STUN attribute.  If the "pending" list is
      empty, the attribute MUST be included with a zero-length value.

   When receiving a binding request with an META-DTLS-IN-STUN attribute,
   the ICE agents embeds

   *  any pending acknowledgments using the META-DTLS-IN-STUN-
      ACKNOWLEDGMENT attribute and

   *  the next pending DTLS packet (determined in a round-robin fashion)
      using the META-DTLS-IN-STUN attribute.  If the "pending" list is
      empty, the attribute MUST be included with a zero-length value.

3.3.5.  For pairs in SUCCEEDED state

   When the ICE candidate pair has received a binding response and is in
   succeeded state, any new DTLS flights SHOULD immediately be sent
   without being embedded in STUN or waiting for the next ICE check.
   This avoids race conditions where the last part of the DTLS handshake
   is buffered waiting for the next STUN packet while DTLS data is
   already sent ahead of the final handshake packets.

   When the STUN agent is sending a scheduled check as described in
   Section 5.8 of [RFC5245] it SHOULD embed

   *  any pending acknowledgments using the META-DTLS-IN-STUN-
      ACKNOWLEDGMENT attribute and

   *  the next pending DTLS packet (determined in a round-robin fashion)
      using the META-DTLS-IN-STUN attribute.

3.3.6.  Resending packets

   Resends should happen with the regularly scheduled ICE checks but MAY
   be triggered by the receipt of an acknowledgment and determining that
   a packet did not arrive as expected (either because it was lost or it
   arrived out of order).

3.3.7.  Sending on multiple candidate pairs

   ICE performs checks on multiple candidate pairs in parallel.  This
   implies that embedding a DTLS packet can happen in rapid succession
   without the packet embedded first having a chance to reach the peer
   and the other side will potentially receive many duplicated DTLS
   packets.

3.3.8.  Lite agents

   Lite ICE agents which are commonly used by servers by definition only
   respond to binding requests and do not send binding requests
   themselves.  Due to the lock-step behavior of DTLS this is not a
   problem, also Lite ICE Agents can send DTLS without embedding once
   they received a valid binding request from a peer.

3.4.  DTLS procedures

   For the protocol described in this specification the DTLS handshake
   is started before ICE finds a valid pair.

   Instead of receiving the DTLS packets after demultiplexing (described
   in Section 7 of [RFC7983]), the DTLS layer receives packets from the
   ICE layer directly.

3.4.1.  MTU considerations

   Embedding DTLS in STUN requires considerations for reducing the MTU
   used by the DTLS layer for the fragmentation of the handshake.  The
   goal is to fit the DTLS handshake packets into STUN packets with a
   predefined maximum size.

   The following attributes must be taken into account:

                                 Table 1

   Applications that use additional STUN attributes MUST reduce the DTLS
   MTU further.  The reduced MTU should only be used until the DTLS
   handshake is complete.

3.4.2.  Handling flights consisting of multiple packets

   A single DTLS flight may be too large to fit into a single UDP
   packet, especially when using Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).

   Addressing this without re-introducing additional delays is an open
   question.

4.  STUN Extensions

4.1.  New attributes

   This specification extends [RFC8489] and defines two new attributes,
   META-DTLS-IN-STUN and META-DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.  These
   attributes are comprehension-optional.

4.2.  META-DTLS-IN-STUN

   The META-DTLS-IN-STUN attribute may be present in binding requests,
   responses and indications.  The value portion of this attribute is
   variable length and consists of the DTLS handshake flights as
   described in Section 5.1 of [RFC9147] or Section 4.2 of [RFC6347].

   If the length of this attribute is not a multiple of 4, then padding
   must be added after this attribute.  If the value portion of this
   attribute is empty or the first byte is not DTLS (i.e. between 20 and
   63 (inclusive) as described in Section 3 of [RFC9443]) the attribute
   SHOULD be silently discarded

   Once the DTLS handshake is completed this attribute SHOULD be
   silently discarded.

4.3.  META-DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

   TODO(NEEDS CONSENSUS): does this attribute have a maximum length?

   The META-DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT attribute may be present in
   binding requests, responses and indications.  The value portion of
   this attribute is variable length and consists of up to four CRC-32
   values that are computed for the META-DTLS-IN-STUN values whose
   receipt the sender acknowledges (similar to the STUN FINGERPRINT
   attribute defined in Section 15.5 of [RFC8489].

   If the length of the value is not a multiple of four or exceeds 16
   bytes this attribute SHOULD be silently discarded.  The order does
   not need to match the order in which the packets were received.

   The attribute MAY be empty but included in a binding request or
   binding response to signal support for the protocol defined in this
   specification.  This typically happens when the SDP answerer has a
   "passive" DTLS role and sends binding requests which may arrive at
   the SDP offerer before the answer.  It is recommended that this
   attribute is included before the META-DTLS-IN-STUN attribute.

5.  SDP Offer/Answer Procedures

   TODO(NEEDS CONSENSUS): is this needed?

   The protocol is designed to work with in-band discovery as described
   above.  If negotiating the protocol via the SDP offer/answer
   mechanism using the 'ice-options' attribute is desired, the
   procedures for that are outlined below.

5.1.  Generating the Initial SDP Offer

   If the offering endpoint supports the extension defined in this
   specification, it includes the "sped" ICE option in the SDP.  The
   offerer MUST be prepared to receive the STUN attributes described
   below even before receiving the SDP answer.

5.2.  Generating the SDP Answer

   An answering endpoint not supporting the ice-option described in this
   document must not include it in its response.  Otherwise the endpoint
   includes the "sped" ice-option in its answer and can start using the
   STUN attributes using the semantics defined below.

5.3.  Offerer Processing of the SDP Answer

   If the answer does not include the "sped" ice-option, the offerer
   SHOULD ignore the STUN attributes defined in this specification and
   MUST NOT send them.  Otherwise the offerer includes the STUN
   attributes using the semantics defined below.

5.4.  Modifying the Session

   Subsequent offers and answers MUST include the ice-option in the
   negotiated SDP with the same value as in the initial negotiation.
   Remote offers MAY renegotiate ice-options only when negotiating a new
   DTLS association as described in Section 5.5 of [RFC8842].

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  DTLS security considerations

   This specification uses application layer caching of DTLS packets
   which means packets may be sent multiple times using the same
   sequence number.  For the receiver these will be considered a replay
   if received multiple times and rejected as described in Section 4.5.1
   of [RFC9147].

   The embedded DTLS handshake is authenticated by the ICE username and
   message-integrity.

6.2.  Pacing and Congestion

   The protocol defined in this specification increases the size of the
   STUN packets that are sent by the ICE agent to a peer without knowing
   if that peer consents to receiving the packets.  The STUN requests
   used for embedding DTLS are already paced as described in
   Appendix B.1 of [RFC8845] which should prevent issues.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines two new STUN attributes, META-DTLS-IN-STUN and
   META-DTLS-IN-STUN-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.  These attributes will need to be
   registered with IANA in the "STUN Attributes" registry, following the
   procedures defined in [RFC8489].  Provisional names have been used in
   this draft and the registry.

   If an ice-option is considered necessary, the IANA shall register the
   following ICE option in the "ICE Options" subregistry of the
   "Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) registry", following
   the procedures defined in [RFC6336].

   *ICE Option*: sped

   *Contact*: TODO

   *Change controller*: TODO

   *Description*: An ICE option of 'sped' indicates support for
   embedding DTLS in STUN as described in this specification.

8.  Prior Work

8.1.  ICE-DTLS

   The ICE-DTLS draft from 2012 proposed a similar mechanism to SPED, in
   which a single RTT could be removed from session setup by replacing
   STUN Request and Response messages with DTLS ClientHello and
   ServerHello messages (rather than piggybacking the DTLS messages as
   SPED does).

   The ICE-DTLS mechanism ends up being considerably more complex than
   SPED, on account of the fact that the entirety of ICE functionality
   needs to be ported over to DTLS (eg consent checks) or retained as a
   complementary approach (eg peer address discovery).  Furthermore,
   since it changes the details of connectivity negotiation, it is not
   backward compatible and therefore must be negotiated via SDP ice-
   options.

   SPED, on the other hand, is inherently backward compatible with
   existing WebRTC implementations.  It is also more compatible with
   demultiplexing multiple ICE sessions using different STUN username
   fragments on the same UDP port.
